# Unity Asset Bundle Browser Plus tool

This tool enables the user to view and edit the configuration of asset bundles for their Unity project.  It will block editing that would create invalid bundles, and inform you of any issues with existing bundles.  It also provides basic build functionality.

This tool is intended to replace the current workflow of selecting assets and setting their asset bundle manually in the inspector.  It can be dropped into any Unity project with a version of 5.6 or greater.  It will create a new menu item in *Window->AssetBundle Browser*.  

# Unofficial Extension
Added BuildMap to group different version assets (click right to Create/Asset Bundles Broswer Plus/BundleBuildMap).
